### Hi there 👋

My name is Vio Stanoj Guerrier, and I've been an information enthusiast since I was a kid! I really started coding 2 years before going to college. I started with Java, then switched to C, which I found more suitable as my first language. 
I started with the famous OpenClassrooms MOOC and with "Le Livre du C premier langage" by Claude Delannoy. 
I've always loved learning on my own, so I practically learned to code on my own, right from my first year at university, when I coded my first real little program 😁 (I lost the code 😔, but I found the executable 😊)! 

While having a serious desire to learn new technologies, I went on to learn quite a few languages and tools 😂!!!
Java, C++ which was my first object-oriented language, then Python, PHP, JS, Qt with which I coded a lot of projects like SWYD.
Later, while working as a developer, I got quite interested in mobile development with Android, then RectNative, I even tested mobile development with Qt 🤫 (I love being curious 😁).

Aside from development, I'm very interested in martial arts, including Kyokushin Karate, which I practice (I'm a Blue Belt 💪🏾).

Today I'm looking forward to discovering and creating even more with new technologies and collaborators !
